**Understanding the Image in a Temporal Context:**

The image shows a series of interconnected boxes, each representing a distinct operation or stage in a process. These stages would map well to Temporal activities and the overall flow would be managed by a Temporal workflow.

  * **`-- PowerShell -- Zip & Transfer to WSL2`**: This could be a Temporal Activity. It involves zipping files and transferring them, likely to a Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 environment. This is a discrete unit of work.

  * **`-- OneDrive -- Download Invoice PDFs`**: This also looks like a prime candidate for a Temporal Activity. Downloading files from OneDrive is a specific, single action.

  * **`--- Python --- REGEX and OCR Output M2 11-digit Order Number CSV`**: This is clearly a strong candidate for a Temporal Activity. It involves Python code performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Regular Expression (REGEX) matching to extract specific data and output a CSV. This is a compute-intensive or I/O-intensive task that could be retried if it fails.

  * **`-- PowerShell -- Transfer CSV to OneDrive`**: Another excellent candidate for a Temporal Activity. Transferring a CSV file to OneDrive is a distinct, external interaction.

**How the Image Relates to Temporal Workflow Definition:**

Based on your description of defining a Temporal Python workflow:

1.  **Create a Workflow Class:** You would define a Python class, let's call it `InvoiceProcessingWorkflow`, to orchestrate the entire process shown in the image.

2.  **Decorate with `@workflow.defn`:** You would apply `@workflow.defn` to your `InvoiceProcessingWorkflow` class:

    ```python
    from temporalio.workflow import workflow

    @workflow.defn
    class InvoiceProcessingWorkflow:
        # ... workflow logic here ...
    ```

3.  **Define the Entry Point (`@workflow.run`):** Inside `InvoiceProcessingWorkflow`, you would have an asynchronous method, likely `run`, decorated with `@workflow.run`. This method would define the sequence of operations.

    ```python
    from temporalio.workflow import workflow, ActivityMethod

    @workflow.defn
    class InvoiceProcessingWorkflow:
        @workflow.run
        async def run(self) -> None:
            # ... orchestrate activities here ...
            pass
    ```

4.  **Orchestrate Activities (`workflow.execute_activity()`):** Within the `run` method, you would call your activities in the order suggested by the diagram. Each box in the image would likely correspond to a separate Temporal activity function (e.g., `download_invoices_from_onedrive`, `zip_and_transfer_to_wsl2`, `process_invoices_with_python`, `transfer_csv_to_onedrive`).

    You would define these activities as separate functions or methods, decorated with `@activity.defn`, and then call them using `await workflow.execute_activity()` within your workflow's `run` method.

**Example Pseudo-code for the Workflow Orchestration:**

```python
from temporalio.workflow import workflow, ActivityMethod

# Assume these are imported from your defined activity file
# from my_activities import (
#     download_invoice_pdfs_activity,
#     zip_transfer_to_wsl2_activity,
#     process_invoices_ocr_regex_activity,
#     transfer_csv_to_onedrive_activity,
# )

# For demonstration, let's define placeholders for activity stubs
# In a real scenario, these would be proper activity definitions
download_invoice_pdfs_activity: ActivityMethod[[], None] = lambda: None
zip_transfer_to_wsl2_activity: ActivityMethod[[], None] = lambda: None
process_invoices_ocr_regex_activity: ActivityMethod[[], None] = lambda: None
transfer_csv_to_onedrive_activity: ActivityMethod[[], None] = lambda: None


@workflow.defn
class InvoiceProcessingWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self) -> None:
        # 1. Download Invoice PDFs from OneDrive
        await workflow.execute_activity(
            download_invoice_pdfs_activity,
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
        )

        # 2. Zip & Transfer to WSL2 (assuming it acts on the downloaded PDFs)
        await workflow.execute_activity(
            zip_transfer_to_wsl2_activity,
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=10),
        )

        # 3. Python REGEX and OCR processing
        await workflow.execute_activity(
            process_invoices_ocr_regex_activity,
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=30), # Might take longer for OCR
        )

        # 4. Transfer CSV to OneDrive
        await workflow.execute_activity(
            transfer_csv_to_onedrive_activity,
            start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
        )

        workflow.logger.info("Invoice processing workflow completed successfully!")

```
